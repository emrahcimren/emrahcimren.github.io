In this post, we will implement a simple three-layer neural network from scratch to explain how neural
networks work.

## What is a Neural Network?

Neural networks use an architecture inspired by the neurons in the brain. 
A brain neuron receives an input and based on that input, fires off an output that is used by another neuron. 
The neural network simulates this behavior in learning about collected data and then predicting outcomes.
