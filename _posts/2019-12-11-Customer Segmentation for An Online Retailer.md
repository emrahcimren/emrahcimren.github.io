In this post, we provide a customer segmentation application for an online apparel retailer. 
Our objective is to divide the customer groups into sub-groups
where each member in each group is very similar
by some measure to each other and very dissimilar to members
in all other groups.

Segmentation is the part of the assortment planning process where we decide *right products*
at the *right quantity* at the *right price* in the *right place* at the *right time* (see Figure 1). We classify customers into groups (segments) based on 
observed or inferred characteristics, behaviors, and preferences.

## Analysis

The objective of this work is first to understand 

- Who is buying the product, 
- How they buy,
- What attributes they value (and don’t value),
- What price they are willing to pay.

Then, we classify customers into groups based on these characteristics.

## Problem

We consider an online woman apparel retailer, called XYZ. XYZ has four selling seasons:

- Spring(Febwk1–Aprwk4)
- Summer(Maywk1–Julwk4)
- Fall(Augwk1–Octwk4)
- Winter(Novwk1–Janwk4)




fall (FA), winter (WA), spring (SP), and summer (SU). At the beginning of each season, they offer an assortment consisting of new products and carryover products from the previous seasons.
