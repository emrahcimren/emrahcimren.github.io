The 2019 INFORMS Annual Meeting was held at Seattle from October 20 to October 23. There were
over 7,000 attendees which was record-breaking. 

I presented my work, **Network Design with Routing Consideration**, where we developed 
a network design algorithm to identify location of distribution facilities
by considering store deliveries. The following is the slide deck.
