In this post, we provide a customer segmentation application for an online apparel retailer. 
Our objective is to divide the customer groups into sub-groups
where each member in each group is very similar
by some measure to each other and very dissimilar to members
in all other groups.

## Analysis

The objective of this work is first to understand 

- Who is buying the product, 
- How they buy,
- What attributes they value (and donâ€™t value),
- What price they are willing to pay.

Then, we classify customers into groups based on these characteristics.

## Retailer XYZ

We consider an online woman apparel retailer, called XYZ. XYZ has four selling seasons; 
Spring (SP), Summer (SU), Fall (FA), and Holiday (HO). Company's objective is to plan 
SP 2017 merchandise.

XYZ's merchandise follows a hierarchical structure (see Figure 1). 

 

Merchandising planning is a process where we determine *right products*
at the *right quantity* at the *right price* in the *right place* 
at the *right time* while meeting company's financial goals. 
Figure 2 shows merchandising planning steps.
