| *Figure 1: Merchandise hierarchy* |

Department denotes high level group of products 
such as Women's Apparel, Women's Footwear, etc. 
When the customer arrives at the store, specific departments contain the merchandise. 
For example, if a customer enters the store and needs a t-shirt, 
she goes to the Women's Apparel department. 
Once in the Women's Apparel department, 
the customer proceeds to the next level of the merchandise hierarchy which is classification. 

XYZ classifies products based on body coverage; tops, bottoms, and dresses. 

Figure 2 shows an example for jeans. Merchandise category
is an assortment of items that customers see as substitutes for each other. 
We Assign products to different categories based on differences in product attributes
and common consumers and buying behaviours.
