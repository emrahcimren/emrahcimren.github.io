## Retailer XYZ

| *Figure 1: Merchandise hierarchy* |

Department denotes high level group of products 
such as Women's Apparel, Women's Footwear, etc. 
When the customer arrives at the store, specific departments contain the merchandise. 
For example, if a consumer enters the store and needs a t-shirt, 
she goes to the Women's Apparel department. 
Once in the Women's Apparel department, 
the consumer proceeds to the next level of the merchandise hierarchy which is classification. 

Classification is a group of items based on body coverage (e.g. tops, bottoms, and dresses). 
Each classification
consists of categories. Merchandise category
is an assortment of items that customers see as substitutes for each other. 
We assign products to different categories based on differences in product attributes
and common consumers and buying behaviours. 

A category consists of Styles where products are grouped based on 
visuals or outer look. Style creates important aesthetic value for consumers.
Stock-keeping unit (SKU) is the smallest unit available for inventory control.
