## Retailer XYZ

| *Figure 1: Merchandise hierarchy* |

Department denotes high level group of products 
such as Women's Apparel, Women's Footwear, etc. 
When the customer arrives at the store, specific departments contain the merchandise. 
For example, if a consumer enters the store and needs a t-shirt, 
she goes to the Women's Apparel department. 
Once in the Women's Apparel department, 
the consumer proceeds to the next level of the merchandise hierarchy which is classification. 

Classification is a group of items based on body coverage (e.g. tops, bottoms, and dresses). 
Each classification
consists of categories. Merchandise category
is an assortment of items that customers see as substitutes for each other. 
We assign products to different categories based on differences in product attributes
and common consumers and buying behaviours. 

A category consists of Styles where products are grouped based on 
visuals or outer look. Style creates important aesthetic value for consumers.
Stock-keeping unit (SKU) is the smallest unit available for inventory control. 

Figure 2 shows an example for Basic Standard-Fit T-Shirt Fire Red Size XS.

We now go over each step with examples.

### 1. Forecast Category Sales

In this step, we first understand the nature of the life cycle of each style. 
Product life cycle is the stages a product goes through after it has been introduced in the market (see Figure 3).

| *Figure 3: Product lifecycle* |

A product follows four stages in its lifecycle:

- Introduction stage: Product is introduced to the market at this stage. 
The cost of the product is high initially since the cost of production is high. 
The product does not face much competition since it has just appeared in the market. 
The company invests mostly in advertising and promoting the product.

- Growth stage: Customer already recognizes the product. Since demand is high, the profit gets increased. 
During this stage, the brands improve the quality of their products, 
add new features, spread more outlets, increase distribution channels, 
and reduce the cost if profit is low. Investing more in promotional 
activity will increase the potential of gaining more profit.

- Maturity stage: In this stage, potential competitors starts threatening the product. The maturity stage defines the time when the product has stabilised in the market. The manufactures now have to make sure the product remains at its position. The manufactures need to think logically before making any decision. They will gradually decrease the cost of the product since the volume of the product has been increased. This is the period when more competitors seem to join the market.

3.Using statistical techniques to project sales
4.Work with vendors to coordinate manufacturing and merchandise delivery with forecasted demand
