In this post, we present a random forest model to predict short term trucking rates.

Transportation rates are driven by different modes of transportation (air, road, rail, and ocean). 
In this work, we focus on trucking related transportation modes, Full Truckload (FTL) and Less than Truckload (LTL).

**Full Truckload (FTL):** An entire truck is used for transportation. 
In the FTL market, truck delivers to destination directly from shipper’s location using a dedicated truck. 
The rate is the same for the use of the full truck whether the truck is 100% full or 
25% full and may be different depending on where the shipment starts and ends. 
Capacity of a truck can be measured in total weight, total cube, or total number of pallets. 
Various truck types are used such as regular dry van, refrigerated, flatbed, tanker, and 48- and 53-foot trailers. 
An FTL carrier may hold 45,000 pounds of product.

**Less than Truckload (LTL):** Companies use LTL when they have a small load to ship to a destination. 
In this case, hiring an entire truck to make the delivery is not economical. 
Trucking company picks up the load, combines it with other companies’ pickup or deliveries, 
and makes the trip to complete a route of deliveries to customer locations. An LTL carrier may 
hold up to 15,000 pounds of product.

Different trailer types carry different products. 
The main types include *dry van*, *flatbed*, *refrigerated/temperature-controlled trailer* and *tank*. 
*Dry van* is the most popular one. The *flatbed trailer* does not have a side wall or ceiling and used to carry 
construction materials or large machinery. Food and medicines are normally hauled by *temperature-controlled*. 
*Tanks* are used to haul refined oil products or chemicals in the liquid form.

Two types of services exists to cover freight transportation requirements, through long-term contracts or 
on the spot market. Contract carriers is used most frequently. The contract is typically a one-year commitment, 
which consists of origin/destination, service requirement, volume and any other factors that affect the price. 
Spot market is used to obtain a rate when there is no availability in the contract market (lane does not exists or 
rate is not accepted).
