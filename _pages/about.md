Hi, I am Emrah Cimren, Lead Data Scientist at Starbucks. I am leading a network optimization team in the Starbuck's Global Supply Chain.

My current work includes long term manufacturing and supply network design and last mile routing. 

I am interested in combining operations research with data science.

Please feel free to contact me if you have any question or comment.
